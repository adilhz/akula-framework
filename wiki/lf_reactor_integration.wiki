Here I'll try to keep track of the changes that go into the *lf_reactor_integration* and what are the desired feautures to be added into the *HEAD*.

==Motivation==
Since the *HEAD* code is relatively stable, a lot of stress tests have passed, it's not yet ready for a first public version. The reason is that the library interfaces are not cleare enough and easy to use and understand.
