Lightweight C++ framework for building network applications. Allows event-driven design, based on the Leader/Followers Reactor pattern as the most effective for UNIX-based systems. The idea behind the framework is simplicity, scalability, very high performance and low dependency from other software. To be a “swiss knife” for network applications. It consists of four parts building the modular framework functionality. The first one is abstraction of the socket-based communication mechanisms. It easily fits into the reactor part, that abstracts the OS-level multiple event sources multiplexing mechanisms. The third part contains most of the needed utilities for every network application like string processing, abstraction of POSIX threads and thread-synchronization mechanisms. Fourth one is for logging and tracing.
The framework also comes with small, modular, easy-to-read, scalable HTTP server, that demonstrates how the framework parts fit into a real-world application. The framework is built on top of the standard C++ library and pthread library as the intent is minimum dependency from other software.
